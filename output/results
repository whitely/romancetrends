  Summary of what the charts reveal:

  | Pattern                 | Examples                       | Implication                        |
  |-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | Explosive recent spike  | Hockey, Historical, Sports     | Viral moments, possibly a hit book |
  | Steady sustained growth | Spicy, Monster, Romantasy      | Durable trend, not just hype       |
  | Growing from zero       | Viking, Scottish, Fae, Sci-fi  | Truly emerging niches              |
  | Flat/declining          | Vampire, Werewolf, Billionaire | Saturated/past peak                |

  The data strongly supports sports romance (especially non-hockey like racing/boxing/soccer) and historical subniches (viking/scottish) as the biggest opportunities - high search growth with declining publishing velocity.
